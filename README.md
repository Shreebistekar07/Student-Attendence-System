# Student-Attendence-System
The project aims to develop a sophisticated attendance tracking system that benefits teachers, students, and college administrators by automating the entire process. It's designed with scalability and code reusability in mind, allowing for easy modifications by adjusting a few variables to achieve different outcomes. Additionally, the project can incorporate new features without disrupting existing ones. This is accomplished through the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a modular approach for designing web services, and adherence to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. These design choices enable the project to be extended to mobile applications and other platforms.
